# Linux Command Line – Hands-On Lab

## Overview
This lab strengthened my skills in working with the Linux command line by connecting to an Amazon Linux AMI through SSH (PuTTY on Windows using a `.ppk` key) and running essential commands to explore system information, user details, timezones, and process history.

The lab focused on three main areas:
1. Accessing an Amazon Linux EC2 instance securely using SSH.
2. Running Linux commands to gather system and user information.
3. Using history and search techniques to improve workflow in the bash shell.

## Key Learnings
- How to securely connect to a Linux instance with PuTTY and SSH keys.
- Basic but critical Linux commands for troubleshooting and exploration.
- Using history search (`CTRL+R`) and command recall (`!!`) to improve efficiency.
- Understanding system information such as user identity, uptime, calendars, and timezones.

---

## Next Steps
- Continue exploring advanced Linux commands (`ps`, `top`, `df`, `free`) for resource monitoring.
- Practice file system navigation (`ls`, `cd`, `pwd`, `cat`) and process management.
- Build custom bash scripts to automate repeated commands.
